\abstract{As of 2022, nearly 5 million smallholder farmers across a dozen countries are covered by Anticipatory Action (AA) programs \citep{chaves-gonzalez_anticipatory_2022}, which are aid schemes triggered if seasonal forecasts of rainfall cross a locally-determined threshold. AA thresholds are often calculated to meet a donor- or government-specified expected trigger frequency \citep{coughlan_de_perez_adapting_2022,world_food_programme_10_2024}. However, the observational rainfall record in many regions with AA programs is limited, and interannual and interdecadal autocorrelation in the climate patterns driving seasonal rainfall further reduce the effective sample size used to calculate these thresholds \citep{martinez_seasonal_2022}. Thus, AA triggers are highly sensitive to the limited observational record, increasing the risk that action is not triggered when it is needed or that programs become financially unsustainable due to excessive triggers. In practice, forecasters are aware of this uncertainty, and ad hoc decisions on whether to trigger action are often made if seasonal forecasts are close to the threshold. Seeking a more formalized, statistically sound alternative to ad hoc approaches, governments and humanitarian agencies have asked for transparent and intuitive metrics for forecast trigger uncertainty. To address this demand, we develop a method for quantifying the uncertainty in thresholds due to a limited observational record using bootstrap resampling. Examining United Nations operational AA forecasts in sub-Saharan Africa, we demonstrate how our method provides a better quantification of critical underlying uncertainty, enabling these AA systems to meet the state-of-the-art demanded by donors and the WMO.}
