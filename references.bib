	abstract = {Abstract
            The societies of the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) are vulnerable to variability in two distinct rainy seasons, the March–May ‘long’ rains and the October–December ‘short’ rains. Recent trends in both rainy seasons, possibly related to patterns of low-frequency variability, have increased interest in future climate projections from General Circulation Models (GCMs). However, previous generations of GCMs historically have poorly simulated the regional hydroclimate. This study conducts a process-based evaluation of simulations of the long and short rains in CMIP6, the latest generation of GCMs. Key biases in CMIP5 remain or are worsened, including long rains that are too short and weak and short rains that are too long and strong. Model biases are driven by a complex set of related oceanic and atmospheric factors, including simulations of the Walker Circulation. Biased wet short rains in models are connected with Indian Ocean zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradients that are too warm in the west and convection that is too deep. Models connect equatorial African winds with the strength of the short rains, though in observations a robust connection is primarily found in the long rains. Model mean state biases in the timing of the western Indian Ocean SST seasonal cycle are associated with certain rainfall timing biases, though both biases may be due to a common source. Simulations driven by historical SSTs (AMIP runs) often have larger biases than fully coupled runs. A path towards using biases to better understand uncertainty in projections of GHA rainfall is suggested.},

	abstract = {The second version of the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) was made operational at NCEP in March 2011. This version has upgrades to nearly all aspects of the data assimilation and forecast model components of the system. A coupled reanalysis was made over a 32-yr period (1979–2010), which provided the initial conditions to carry out a comprehensive reforecast over 29 years (1982–2010). This was done to obtain consistent and stable calibrations, as well as skill estimates for the operational subseasonal and seasonal predictions at NCEP with CFSv2. The operational implementation of the full system ensures a continuity of the climate record and provides a valuable up-to-date dataset to study many aspects of predictability on the seasonal and subseasonal scales. Evaluation of the reforecasts show that the CFSv2 increases the length of skillful MJO forecasts from 6 to 17 days (dramatically improving subseasonal forecasts), nearly doubles the skill of seasonal forecasts of 2-m temperatures over the United States, and significantly improves global SST forecasts over its predecessor. The CFSv2 not only provides greatly improved guidance at these time scales but also creates many more products for subseasonal and seasonal forecasting with an extensive set of retrospective forecasts for users to calibrate their forecast products. These retrospective and real-time operational forecasts will be used by a wide community of users in their decision making processes in areas such as water management for rivers and agriculture, transportation, energy use by utilities, wind and other sustainable energy, and seasonal prediction of the hurricane season.},

Atmosphere-only and coupled integrations capture the gross observed patterns of seasonal progression and give mean onset/cessation dates within 18 days of the observational dates for 11 of the 13 regions considered. Accurate representation of seasonality over central-southern Africa and West Africa (excluding the southern coastline) adds credence for future projected changes in seasonality here. However, coupled simulations exhibit timing biases over the Horn of Africa, with the long rains 20 days late on average. Although both sets of simulations detect biannual rainfall seasonal cycles for East and Central Africa, coupled simulations fail to capture the biannual regime over the southern West African coastline. This is linked with errors in the Gulf of Guinea sea surface temperature (SST) and deficient representation of the SST/rainfall relationship.},

	abstract = {This commentary discusses new advances in the predictability of east African rains and highlights the potential for improved early warning systems (EWS), humanitarian relief efforts, and agricultural decision-making. Following an unprecedented sequence of five droughts, 23 million east Africans faced starvation in 2022, requiring {\textgreater}\$2 billion in aid. Here, we update climate attribution studies showing that these droughts resulted from an interaction of climate change and La Niña. Then we describe, for the first time, how attribution-based insights can be combined with the latest dynamical models to predict droughts at 8-month lead-times. We then discuss behavioral and social barriers to forecast use, and review literature examining how EWS might (or might not) enhance agro-pastoral advisories and humanitarian interventions. Finally, in reference to the new World Meteorological Organization “Early Warning for All” Executive Action Plan, we conclude with a set of recommendations supporting actionable and authoritative climate services. Trust, urgency, and accuracy can help overcome barriers created by limited funding, uncertain tradeoffs, and inertia. Understanding how climate change is producing predictable climate extremes now, investing in African-led EWS, and building better links between EWS and agricultural development efforts can support long-term adaptation, reducing chronic needs for billions of dollars in reactive assistance. In Africa and beyond, climate change brings increasingly extreme sea surface temperature (SST) gradients. Using climate models, we can often see these extremes coming. Prediction, therefore, offers opportunities for proactive risk management and improved advisory services, if we can create effective societal linkages via cross-silo collaborations.},

	abstract = {Abstract The societies of the coastal regions of the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) experience two distinct rainy seasons: the generally wetter “long” rains in the boreal spring and the generally drier “short” rains in the boreal fall. The GHA rainfall climatology is unique for its latitude in both its aridity and for the dynamical differences between its two rainy seasons. This study explains the drivers of the rainy seasons through the climatology of moist static stability, estimated as the difference between surface moist static energy hs and midtropospheric saturation moist static energy h*. In areas and at times when this difference, hs−h*, is higher, rainfall is more frequent and more intense. However, even during the rainy seasons, hs−h*{\textless}0 on average and the atmosphere remains largely stable, in line with the GHA’s aridity. The seasonal cycle of hs−h*, to which the unique seasonal cycles of surface humidity, surface temperature, and midtropospheric temperature all contribute, helps explain the double-peaked nature of the regional hydroclimate. Despite tropospheric temperature being relatively uniform in the tropics, even small changes in h* can have substantial impacts on instability; for example, during the short rains, the annual minimum in GHA h* lowers the threshold for convection and allows for instability despite surface humidity anomalies being relatively weak. This hs−h* framework can help identify the drivers of interannual variability in GHA mean rainfall or diagnose the origin of biases in climate model simulations of the regional climate.},

	abstract = {Despite the importance of pastoralism in many East African communities, there is a dearth of research in the region on how multi-season droughts affect pastoralists. Using a panel dataset of 1064 pastoralists surveyed over 6 years in Kenya, we compare how two successive drought events in 2009 and 2011 affected households’ animal holdings, decision-making, livelihoods, and long-term recovery. Both droughts were associated with reduced household income from livestock and increased expenditure on water, and households took an average of 3–4 years to replenish their herd to its pre-drought size. But, we find that the 2011 drought was significantly worse for households in terms of livestock losses, despite the two events appearing comparable on standard biophysical drought indices over Marsabit County. Importantly, we show that the two successive droughts had compounding effects - greater proportional losses in 2009 led to longer herd recovery times after 2011. We also find that restocking offsets this effect, suggesting that the households most vulnerable to successive droughts are those which lack the financial or social means to replenish their herd. Our findings have implications for how shocks relate to welfare among pastoralists, highlighting the importance for humanitarian organizations to consider compounding risks over a multiyear timescale.},

These tests can check if data available for a site are consistent with a regional GEV distribution, except for scale, or if the data are consistent with a GEV distribution with a regional value of the shape parameter κ. Three tests employ unbiased probability-weighted moment (PWM) estimators of the L moment coefficient of variation (L-CV), and coefficient of skewness (L-CS) using formulas for their variances in small samples. In a Monte Carlo power study the L-CV test was often more powerful than the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test at detecting L-CV inconsistencies. A test based upon L-CS generally has equal or greater power than the probability plot correlation test at detecting L-CS differences; both are poor at detecting thin-tailed alternatives. Finally, a new chi-square test based upon sample estimates of both the L-CV and L-CS, and their anticipated cross correlation, was much better than other tests at detecting departures from the assumed L-CV, L-CS, or both, particularly when the regional distribution was highly skewed.},

Typically, these people are poor and heavily dependent on rainfed agriculture and livestock. Most live in Africa, Central America, or Southwest Asia. When the rains fail, incomes diminish while food prices increase, cutting off the poorest (most often women and children) from access to adequate nutrition. As seen in Ethiopia in 1984 and Somalia in 2011, food shortages can lead to famine. Yet these slow-onset disasters also provide opportunities for effective intervention, as seen in Ethiopia in 2015 and Somalia in 2017. Since 1985, the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) has been providing evidence-based guidance for effective humanitarian relief efforts. FEWS NET depends on a Drought Early Warning System (DEWS) to help understand, monitor, model, and predict food insecurity. Here we provide an overview of FEWS NET’s DEWS using examples from recent climate extremes. While drought monitoring and prediction provides just one part of FEWS NET’s monitoring system, it draws from many disciplines—remote sensing, climate prediction, agroclimatic monitoring, and hydrologic modeling. Here we describe FEWS NET’s multiagency multidisciplinary DEWS and Food Security Outlooks. This DEWS uses diagnostic analyses to guide predictions. Midseason droughts are monitored using multiple cutting-edge Earth-observing systems. Crop and hydrologic models can translate these observations into impacts. The resulting information feeds into FEWS NET reports, helping to save lives by motivating and targeting timely humanitarian assistance.},

Based on previous work, which identified several variables that could provide predictive skill of rainfall in the region, canonical correlation analysis is applied to assess forecast skill for station-averaged sub-regional frequency and intensity of the Early-Rainy Season (ERS) and Late-Rainy Season (LRS) wet days, and magnitude of the Mid-Summer Drought (MSD). Predictor fields are explored from the ERA-Interim and North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME). The use of sea-level pressure (SLP), 850 hPa zonal winds (u850), vertically integrated zonal (UQ), and meridional (VQ) moisture fluxes show comparable, if not better, forecast skill than sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), which is generally the commonly-used predictor in a given region’s seasonal climate forecasts. Generally, the highest predictive skill is found for the frequency of wet days. Rainfall characteristics in the Central and Eastern Caribbean have significant predictive skill. Forecast skill of rainfall characteristics in the Northwestern and Western Caribbean are lower and less consistent. The sub-regional differences and consistently significant skill across lead times up to at least two months can be attributed to persistent SST/SLP anomalies during the ERS that resemble the North Atlantic Oscillation, and that resembles the summer-time onset of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation during the LRS. The anomalous spatial patterns during the MSD bear resemblance to both the ERS and LRS signals. The results provide additional variables that can be used to forecast rainfall characteristics in the Caribbean and a way to tailor seasonal forecasts for each sub-region.},

Given the growing interest in this climate change adaptation solution, we assess how well weather early warnings perform for extreme events in different parts of the world. First, we carry out a forecast verification for weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for 95th percentile extreme heat and extreme precipitation globally at 0.5° resolution, with three days of lead time. We present the results alongside similar verification results from ECMWF forecasts and a CHIRPS-GEFS forecast, to identify regions of the world with consistent forecast skill. We then overlay the skill of these short-term weather forecasts on top of climate change projections for the increasing frequency of the extreme events themselves. Based on these results, we offer policy implications for EWS investments in different regions. We find that in much of the tropics, weather forecasts have relatively poor skill in forecasting extreme temperature and precipitation events, calling for further investments in predictability. In the extra-tropics, most extreme heat and extreme precipitation events can be correctly forecasted, with better results for multi-day events and shorter lead-times. While there is room to improve predictability, end-to-end investments in EWS in these regions can focus on the use of existing skillful forecasts. Finally, most of the world's land area is projected to see an increase in the magnitude of extreme heat and precipitation events with climate change, and EWS investments in these regions should prepare for unprecedented extremes and changing vulnerabilities. These results provide a foundation for localized research on EWS in different parts of the world as well as evidence for policy and donors on how best to invest in EWS in different regions.},

	abstract = {Globally, the direct cost of natural disasters stands in the hundreds of billions of USD per year, at a time when water resources are under increasing stress and variability. Much of this burden rests on low- and middle-income countries that, despite their relative lack of wealth, exhibit considerable vulnerability such that losses measurably impact GDP. Within these countries, a growing middle class retains much of its wealth in property that may be increasingly exposed, while the few assets the poor may possess are often highly exposed. Vulnerability to extreme events is thus heterogeneous at both the global and subnational level. Moreover, the distribution and predictability of extreme events is also heterogeneous. Disaster managers and relief organizations are increasingly consulting operational climate information services as a way to mitigate the risks of extreme events, but appropriately targeting vulnerable communities remains a challenge. The advent of forecast-based anticipatory action has added to the suite of opportunities—and complexity—of operationalizing such services given varying prediction skill. Forecasts, including those at the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) scale, may allow disaster managers to shift effort and therefore some risk from post-disaster response to pre-disaster preparedness; however, given the recent emergence of such programs, only a few, specific case studies have been evaluated. We therefore conduct a country-scale analysis pairing S2S forecast skill for monthly and seasonal lead times with flood and drought disaster risk to explore the potential for forecast-based anticipatory action programs broadly. To investigate subnational heterogeneity in risk and predictability, we also evaluate focused outcomes for the Greater Horn of Africa and Peru. Results suggest that forecast skill plays a large part in determining suitability for early action, and that skill itself varies considerably by disaster type, lead time, and location. Moreover, the physical and socioeconomic factors of risk can vary greatly between national and subnational levels, such that finer scale evaluations may considerably improve the effectiveness of early action protocols. By considering vulnerability at multiple spatial scales and forecast skill at multiple temporal scales, this analysis provides a first identification of promising locations for anticipatory action protocol development.},

	abstract = {Disaster risk reduction efforts traditionally focus on long-term preventative measures or post-disaster response. Outside of these, there are many short-term actions, such as evacuation, that can be implemented in the period of time between a warning and a potential disaster to reduce the risk of impacts. However, this precious window of opportunity is regularly overlooked in the case of climate and weather forecasts, which can indicate heightened risk of disaster but are rarely used to initiate preventative action. Barriers range from the protracted debate over the best strategy for intervention to the inherent uncomfortableness on the part of donors to invest in a situation that will likely arise but is not certain. In general, it is unclear what levels of forecast probability and magnitude are "worth" reacting to. Here, we propose a novel forecast-based financing system to automatically trigger action based on climate forecasts or observations. The system matches threshold forecast probabilities with appropriate actions, disburses required funding when threshold forecasts are issued, and develops standard operating procedures that contain the mandate to act when these threshold forecasts are issued. We detail the methods that can be used to establish such a system, and provide illustrations from several pilot cases. Ultimately, such a system can be scaled up in disaster-prone areas worldwide to improve effectiveness at reducing the risk of disaster.},

	abstract = {Climate shocks are causing increasingly severe damage and amplifying humanitarian needs. So far, humanitarian action has been mostly responsive, arriving after a crisis has materialized. With recent advances in forecasting, humanitarian and development organizations have been able to anticipate and respond ahead of crises. “Anticipatory action” (AA) seeks to ensure aid is provided before the peak impact of a shock occurs, reducing suffering and humanitarian needs. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has been developing AA frameworks since 2019, coordinating collective AA and mobilizing finance. To date, these pilots have reached approximately 2.2 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Bangladesh. In six countries (Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Malawi, Nepal, Niger, and The Philippines), frameworks are in place to reach a further 2.3 million people should the triggers be reached. OCHA is facilitating the design of AA plans in Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Madagascar, Mozambique and South Sudan. We share lessons from the pilots, focusing on three components: triggers, programming, and financing. We report that triggers must be sufficiently reliable to warrant action and funds disbursement. Forecasts are not available for all countries or hazards, and existing forecasts may not provide desired resolution or skill (accuracy) levels, especially at longer lead times. The timing of action therefore must balance forecast skill against operational needs. Funding is best when it is flexible and includes finance for framework design, evaluation and continued improvements. Finally we discuss the challenges and opportunities in scaling up AA.},

	abstract = {Acting in advance of floods, drought and cyclones often requires decision-makers to work with weather forecasts. The inherently probabilistic nature of these forecasts can be problematic when deciding whether to act or not. Cost-loss analysis has previously been employed to support forecast based decision-making such as Forecast-based Financing (FbF), providing insight to when an FbF system has ‘potential economic value’ relative to a no-forecast alternative. One well-known limitation of cost-loss analysis is the difficulty of estimating losses (which vary with hazard magnitude and extent, and with the dynamics of population vulnerability and exposure). A less-explored limitation is ignorance of the temporal dynamics (sequencing) of costs and losses. That is, even if the potential economic value of a forecast system is high, the stochastic nature of the atmosphere and the probabilistic nature of forecasts could conspire over the first few forecasts to increase the expense of using the system over the no-forecast alternative. Thus, for a forecast-based action system to demonstrate value, it often needs to be used over a prolonged length of time. However, knowing exactly how long it must be used to guarantee value is unquantified. This presents difficulties to institutions mandated to protect those at risk, who must justify the use of limited funds to act in advance of a potential, but not definite disaster, whilst planning multi-year strategies. Here we show how to determine the period over which decision makers must use forecasts in order to be confident of achieving ‘value’ over a no-forecast alternative. Results show that in the context of seasonal forecasting it is plausible that more than a decade may pass before a FbF system will have some certainty of showing value, and that if a particular user requires an almost-certain guarantee that using a forecast will be better than a no-forecast strategy, they must hold out until a near-perfect forecast system is available. The implication: there is potential value in seasonal forecasts, but to exploit it one must be prepared to play the long game.},

	abstract = {In their recent seasonal forecast guidance, the World Meteorological Organization recommended using an objective seasonal forecast system that includes a traceable, reproducible, and well-documented set of steps. Such a forecast system is the backbone of any successful climate service, which should provide advanced warning to government, industry, and communities, and thereby help reduce the impacts of adverse climatic conditions. In this study, we present the Next Generation (NextGen) seasonal forecast system which was recently adopted by the National Meteorological Agency (NMA) of Ethiopia. NextGen is based on a calibrated multi-model ensemble (CMME) approach that uses state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCM) from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble project. A canonical correlation analysis-based regression is used to calibrate the predictions from the GCMs against observations. The calibrated GCMs are then combined with equal weight to make final CMME predictions. A hindcast skill assessment of the CMME predictions has been depicted in this study for three rainy seasons in Ethiopia, namely Belg: Feb to May, Kiremt: Jun to Sep, and Bega: Oct to Jan. Over the region, the resulting forecasts are characterized by moderate skill at lead-1 for all three seasons. NextGen forecasting system shows that Bega rain-benefiting areas demonstrate the highest deterministic and probabilistic skill when compared to Kiremt and Belg rainy areas. The real-time experimental forecast of Kiremt2020 was conducted using NextGen by NMA and proved quite successful in capturing precipitation anomalies comparable to observations.},

We evaluate 253 real-time forecasts of the Niño 3.4 index issued from February 2002 to February 2023 and examine multimodal means of dynamical (DYN) and statistical (STAT) models separately. Forecast skill diminishes as lead time increases in both DYN and STAT forecasts, with peak accuracy occurring post-northern hemisphere spring predictability barrier and preceding seasons. The DYN forecasts outperform STAT forecasts with a pronounced advantage in forecasts initiated from late boreal winter through spring. The analysis uncovers an asymmetry in predicting the onset of cold and warm ENSO episodes, with warm episode onsets being better forecasted than cold onsets in both DYN and STAT models. The DYN forecasts are found to be valuable for predicting warm and cold ENSO episode onsets at least several months in advance, while STAT forecasts are less informative about ENSO phase transitions. The results indicate that predicting ENSO onset is challenging and that the ability to do so is both model- and event-dependent.},

	abstract = {Statistical post-processing of dynamical forecasts, using the Model Output Statistics (MOS) approach, continues to be an essential component of weather forecasting. Even in the current era of ensemble forecasting, ensemble-MOS methods are used to transform raw ensemble forecasts into well-calibrated probability forecasts. Logistic regression has been found to be an especially useful method for this purpose for predictands, such as precipitation amounts, that are distinctly non-Gaussian. However, the usual implementation of logistic regression fits separate forecast equations for different predictand thresholds, yielding finite sets of threshold probabilities rather than full forecast probability distributions. Furthermore, these individual threshold probabilities are not constrained to be mutually consistent, so that negative probabilities may be implied for some ranges of the predictand. In this paper, logistic regressions are extended to yield full continuous, and coherent, probability distribution forecasts by including the predictand threshold itself as an additional predictor in the forecast equation. The procedure is illustrated using 6–10 day precipitation forecasts for a sample of locations in the U.S., drawn from the GFS reforecast dataset. Copyright © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society},

Logistic regressions and nonhomogeneous Gaussian regressions are generally preferred for daily temperature, and for medium-range (6–10 and 8–14 day) temperature and precipitation forecasts. However, the better sharpness of medium-range ensemble-dressing forecasts sometimes yields the best Brier scores even though their calibration is somewhat worse. Using the long (15 or 25 yr) training samples that are available with these reforecasts improves the accuracy and skill of these probabilistic forecasts to levels that are approximately equivalent to gains of 1 day of lead time, relative to using short (1 or 2 yr) training samples.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},
